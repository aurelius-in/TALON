# Threat Model (STRIDE)

**Customer/Vendor:** Blue Eagle Robotics (BER) / Reliable AI Network (RAIN)  
**Product:** TALON — Tactical Agentic Layer for Orchestrated eNvironments  
**Version/Date:** v0.1 • 2025‑09-30 

---

## 1. Context and Assets

TALON is an agentic control plane that coordinates perception jobs and infrastructure changes across a network of edge devices and cloud services.  
This threat model identifies the assets to protect, the threats that could compromise them, and the mitigations required to maintain confidentiality, integrity and availability.

### Assets

- **Identity and Access:** User accounts, service accounts, API tokens, OAuth credentials and secrets stored in a vault.
- **Source Code and Pipelines:** Git repositories, Terraform modules, CI/CD pipelines, build artifacts and container images.
- **Infrastructure and Configuration:** Kubernetes clusters, virtual machines, networks, load balancers, message brokers and service mesh configuration.
- **Data Stores:** Job metadata and state in databases, provenance and audit logs, large binary artifacts in object storage (e.g., images, plan files).
- **Logging and Monitoring Systems:** Centralized logs, metrics, traces, dashboards and alerting rules.
- **External Integrations:** Sensors and cameras, third‑party APIs, external secrets management, identity providers and webhooks.

Understanding these assets and the trust boundaries around them is critical for identifying relevant threats.

## 2. Threat Identification

STRIDE categorizes threats into six groups: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privilege.  
For each category, this section outlines the risks relevant to TALON and proposes specific mitigations.

### 2.1 Spoofing

**Threat:** Attackers may impersonate a trusted user or service by stealing or forging credentials. Compromised API tokens, machine identities or federated credentials can provide unauthorized access. Long‑lived service tokens or poorly stored secrets increase exposure.

**Scenarios:**
- Forging service account tokens to submit perception or infra jobs.
- Intercepting user credentials via phishing or compromised endpoints.
- Using leaked API keys to call internal services.

**Mitigations:**
- Enforce multi‑factor authentication for all human users and require hardware or app‑based TOTP factors.
- Issue short‑lived, scoped OAuth tokens and automatically rotate secrets via a secrets manager.
- Scan repositories and pipelines for hardcoded secrets and enforce pre‑commit checks.
- Use mutual TLS for service‑to‑service communications and verify certificates against a trusted CA.
- Implement strong identity lifecycle management and least‑privilege access control policies.

### 2.2 Tampering

**Threat:** Unauthorized modification of code, configuration or data undermines system integrity. Attackers could inject malicious code into CI/CD pipelines, alter infrastructure templates or manipulate stored artifacts.

**Scenarios:**
- Modifying Terraform modules or container manifests to introduce backdoors.
- Injecting malicious code into the vision service or infra agent.
- Altering plan artifacts or sensor data before execution.

**Mitigations:**
- Sign all build artifacts and container images using a trusted signing solution. Verify signatures before deployment.
- Enforce least‑privileged access in source control, CI/CD systems and registries. Grant write access only when necessary.
- Validate file hashes and checksums at each stage of deployment to detect tampering.
- Store logs and provenance records in append‑only, tamper‑evident storage; make artifacts immutable in object storage.
- Integrate SAST, DAST and dependency scanning tools into CI/CD pipelines and mandate peer review for code and infrastructure changes.

### 2.3 Repudiation

**Threat:** Without verifiable audit trails, malicious actors or insiders can deny performing certain actions. Missing or modifiable logs hamper incident response and complicate forensic investigations.

**Scenarios:**
- A user denies submitting a job that caused an incident.
- A developer disputes introducing vulnerable code into the repository.
- An operator claims they did not approve a deployment.

**Mitigations:**
- Generate append‑only, tamper‑evident audit logs and digitally sign them at the point of creation.
- Centralize log collection in a SIEM platform; retain logs with integrity validation.
- Include job IDs, user IDs and timestamps in all log entries; maintain provenance records linking actions to identities.
- Use digital signatures to provide non‑repudiation for critical actions (e.g., code commits, approvals).
- Synchronize system clocks and implement time‑stamping to preserve the chronological order of events.

### 2.4 Information Disclosure

**Threat:** Sensitive data such as customer records, credentials or proprietary code may be exposed through misconfigurations or overly permissive API responses. Rapid scaling can lead to visibility gaps around data location and access.

**Scenarios:**
- Publicly exposed object storage buckets containing perception images or plan artifacts.
- APIs returning more data than necessary, leaking secrets or confidential metadata.
- Logs inadvertently capturing sensitive information.

**Mitigations:**
- Encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.2+ and at rest using strong algorithms such as AES‑256.
- Apply strict access controls to databases and object stores. Limit API responses to only the necessary fields.
- Continuously scan cloud environments for misconfigurations using automated tools. Regularly audit permissions and remove excessive access.
- Implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks and avoid logging sensitive fields.
- Classify data by sensitivity and enforce handling rules accordingly.

### 2.5 Denial of Service (DoS)

**Threat:** Attackers may attempt to overwhelm APIs, load balancers or message brokers with excessive traffic, exhausting compute, memory or network resources and causing service degradation or outages.

**Scenarios:**
- Distributed attacks targeting the public API endpoints to exhaust rate limits.
- Flooding queues or brokers, preventing legitimate jobs from being processed.
- Triggering uncontrolled auto‑scaling events leading to cost spikes and resource starvation.

**Mitigations:**
- Apply rate limits, quotas and request throttling on public interfaces and APIs.
- Introduce circuit breakers, timeouts and backpressure controls to prevent cascading failures.
- Leverage managed DDoS protection services and Web Application Firewalls on ingress points.
- Validate auto‑scaling policies to prevent runaway scaling; allocate dedicated resources for critical services.
- Monitor queue depths and process backlogs; implement quotas and resource reservation.

### 2.6 Elevation of Privilege (EoP)

**Threat:** Attackers exploit overly permissive IAM roles or misconfigured policies to gain higher privileges than intended, enabling lateral movement and escalation.

**Scenarios:**
- A compromised service account inherits admin-level permissions due to a misconfigured role.
- Broad access is granted to developers to speed up delivery, creating easy escalation paths.
- Kubernetes RBAC roles allow pods to mount sensitive host volumes or access secrets.

**Mitigations:**
- Enforce least‑privilege policies across the platform. Grant users and services only the permissions they require.
- Implement just‑in‑time access controls for sensitive actions, requiring approvals and automatic expiration.
- Regularly audit IAM roles, access policies and Kubernetes RBAC rules. Remove unused or overly permissive permissions.
- Monitor for abnormal escalation patterns via SIEM alerts and respond quickly to suspicious activity.
- Segregate duties and require multiple approvers for high‑risk operations.

## 3. Cross‑Cutting Mitigations

- **Segmentation and Trust Boundaries:** Define clear trust boundaries between control plane, data plane and external integrations. Use network policies and micro‑segmentation to reduce lateral movement.
- **Secure Development Lifecycle:** Embed threat modeling, static and dynamic analysis, and dependency scanning into CI/CD. Enforce peer review and approval processes for code and infrastructure changes.
- **Supply Chain Security:** Use signed commits, verify dependencies, generate software bills of materials (SBOMs) and validate signatures on artifacts. Maintain tamper‑evident logs and provenance.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Centralize logs, metrics and traces. Establish dashboards and alerts for anomalies, thresholds and security events. Conduct regular incident response exercises.
- **Policy as Code:** Employ frameworks like Open Policy Agent (OPA) to codify and enforce authorization, rate limiting and configuration policies. Integrate these policies into service meshes and API gateways.

## 4. Continuous Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is not a one‑time activity. It should be performed during architectural design and revisited whenever trust boundaries change—such as when new services are introduced, third‑party integrations are added or identity policies are modified.  
Automate security control validations in CI/CD pipelines and embed policy enforcement in runtime environments. Version‑control this threat model and integrate it with architecture documentation, security control libraries and pipeline validation gates. Align threat modeling activities with compliance requirements and risk management processes.

## 5. Conclusion

This STRIDE‑based threat model identifies key assets, risks and mitigation strategies for the TALON platform. By implementing the recommended controls, continuously revisiting the model as the system evolves and enforcing policies throughout the development and operational lifecycle, RAIN and Blue Eagle Robotics can proactively reduce security risks and improve the resilience of their AI‑driven operations.
