## Purpose

This document defines coding, containerisation and logging standards for the TALON platform. It supports reliable delivery, maintainability and security across code, images and infrastructure. Following these standards ensures that RAIN engineers produce readable, secure software, build trustworthy containers and generate useful logs to support operations, compliance and audits.

## Coding standards

### Style and readability

- **Adopt a consistent style guide:** Use an established style guide for each language (e.g. PEP 8 for Python, Google Java Style for JavaScript/TypeScript). Employ automated formatters (Black, Prettier) and linters (flake8, ESLint) to enforce style.
- **Clear naming:** Choose descriptive names for files, functions, variables and modules; avoid abbreviations.
- **Modular, testable design:** Break code into small, single‑responsibility functions and modules; write unit and integration tests for critical paths; integrate tests into CI.
- **Documentation:** Provide module‑ and function‑level docstrings and inline comments that explain intent. Maintain high‑level architecture documentation and README files.
- **Version control:** All source code, infrastructure manifests and configuration must be stored in a version control system (Git). Never commit secrets. Follow a branching model with pull requests and code reviews to ensure at least one peer review for every change.

### Secure coding practices

- **Input validation and sanitisation:** Treat all inputs as untrusted. Validate data types, ranges and formats server‑side; sanitise or escape data when constructing queries or commands to prevent injection.
- **Least privilege and access control:** Require authentication for all endpoints and enforce authorization checks; ensure sensitive operations are restricted to appropriate roles.
- **Dependency management:** Declare dependencies explicitly and keep them up to date. Use tools to monitor for CVEs and license issues. Avoid end‑of‑life libraries. Replace deprecated or vulnerable packages promptly.
- **Secrets management:** Never hard‑code secrets (API keys, passwords, private keys) in source code. Retrieve secrets at runtime from an encrypted secrets manager. Rotate credentials regularly and limit their scope.
- **Error handling:** Catch exceptions and return user‑friendly messages without exposing stack traces or internal details. Log errors securely.
- **Code signing:** Sign build artifacts (binaries, containers, packages) using an automated process integrated with the CI/CD pipeline. Use hardware security modules or cloud key management to store signing keys and ensure only authorised processes can sign artifacts.

## Container standards

### Building images

- **Use minimal, trusted base images:** Start from trusted registries and minimal distributions (Alpine Linux, Debian‑Slim) to reduce attack surface and dependencies. Validate base images against vendor guidance and third‑party best practices.
- **Run as non‑privileged users:** Configure containers to run as a non‑root user. Validate image configuration settings and enforce policies that block images which run processes as root.
- **Immutable images:** Design images to be immutable. Avoid installing packages or updates at runtime. Do not enable SSH or remote shells inside containers.
- **Secrets outside images:** Store secrets outside container images and inject them at runtime using orchestrator features (e.g. Kubernetes secrets). Ensure secrets are encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Image scanning and malware detection:** Continuously scan images for vulnerabilities and malware using static and dynamic analysis. Monitor CVE scores and update base layers frequently. Enforce policies that block images with critical vulnerabilities from being deployed.
- **Trusted registries and image signatures:** Maintain a list of trusted images and registries; enforce that only signed images from approved registries can be pulled and executed. Validate image signatures before deployment and ensure registries use secure connections.
- **Prune stale images:** Regularly remove outdated or vulnerable images from registries. Use discrete version tags instead of relying on the “latest” tag to ensure predictable deployments.

### Running containers

- **Segmentation by sensitivity:** Group containers based on sensitivity levels (e.g. financial, public) and run each group on separate hosts or nodes. This limits lateral movement and prevents sensitive data leakage.
- **Runtime hardening:** Keep container runtimes and orchestrators patched. Monitor for CVEs affecting runtimes and upgrade promptly.
- **Network controls:** Restrict container egress and ingress traffic to only required destinations. Use service mesh or network policies to enforce least‑privilege communication. Monitor inter‑container traffic and detect anomalies.
- **Resource limits:** Define CPU, memory and storage limits to prevent noisy neighbours and denial‑of‑service risks. Use read‑only root filesystems where possible.

## Logging standards

Effective logging is critical for observability, security and compliance. Use the following practices:

- **Logging strategy and policies:** Define what should be logged, where logs are stored, who can access them and how long they are retained. Establish procedures for reviewing logs, responding to alerts and practising incident response.
- **Identify critical events:** Log authentication events, authorization failures, database queries, API calls, configuration changes and other actions that are relevant for auditing and compliance.
- **Structured logs:** Format logs consistently using key–value or JSON structures so they are easy to parse and analyse. Include at minimum: timestamp, log level, system/service name, unique identifiers (request ID, user ID), and message.
- **Centralize logging:** Aggregate logs from all components (services, containers, hosts, network devices) into a central log platform separate from production infrastructure for correlation and long‑term storage.
- **Context and indexing:** Add relevant metadata (usernames, IP addresses, session IDs) to log entries to support forensic investigations. Enable indexing to speed up search and analytics.
- **Scalable storage:** Use scalable log storage (e.g. cloud logging services) to accommodate varying retention requirements.
- **Access controls:** Restrict who can view, modify or delete logs; implement role‑based access controls and audit access regularly.
- **Real‑time monitoring and alerts:** Enable real‑time monitoring and alerting for critical events. Integrate with incident management tools to ensure immediate response to suspicious activity.
- **Secure logging:** Avoid logging sensitive data such as passwords, tokens or personal identifiable information. Where sensitive information is logged, mask or encrypt it.
- **Periodic review:** Assess the usefulness of logs periodically, eliminating low‑value logs and ensuring critical logs remain available.

## Integration with CI/CD

- **Version control and IaC:** Treat infrastructure, pipelines and policies as code. Use version control for all pipeline definitions and infrastructure code.
- **Automated checks:** Configure the CI pipeline to run linters, unit tests, security scanners and static analysis tools on every commit. Fail the pipeline early if issues are detected.
- **Plan → policy → approval → apply:** For infrastructure changes, generate a plan (e.g. Terraform plan), evaluate it against policy (e.g. OPA guardrails), obtain approvals and then apply changes. Require multi‑factor approval for production changes.
- **Rollback:** Enable rollbacks and maintain previous versions of artifacts to recover quickly if a deployment causes issues.
- **Monitoring CI/CD environment:** Monitor the CI/CD pipeline itself for anomalies, misconfigurations and access issues.
- **Security and governance left:** Integrate security and compliance checks early in the pipeline, including container scanning and secret scanning.
- **Artifact signing and provenance:** Sign all artifacts produced by the pipeline, store signatures in a secure registry and record provenance details for each build.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these standards, RAIN will deliver high‑quality software and containers for the TALON platform that are maintainable, secure and auditable. Consistent coding practices improve readability and reduce defects; container best practices minimise attack surfaces and ensure controlled deployments; and robust logging provides the observability and forensic capabilities required for modern industrial systems. Continuous integration of these standards into the CI/CD workflow ensures that security, quality and compliance are baked into every release.
