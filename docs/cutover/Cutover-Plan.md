# Cutover Plan

**Customer/Vendor:** Blue Eagle Robotics (BER) / Reliable AI Network (RAIN)  
**Product:** TALON — Tactical Agentic Layer for Orchestrated eNvironments  
**Version/Date:** v0.1 • 2025‑09‑29  

---

## Purpose

This cutover plan outlines the activities required to transition Blue Eagle Robotics from their current operating state to **TALON**, a unified agentic platform for perception and infrastructure orchestration.  It is designed to coordinate people, processes and tools so that the switchover is orderly, transparent and minimally disruptive.  The plan also specifies owners for each task, a communication framework and a rollback strategy should the transition encounter issues.

## Scope

The cutover encompasses the final deployment of TALON into production, including the migration of data and configurations, the switchover of monitoring and alerting, and the training of operational staff.  Activities outside this scope—such as development, user‑acceptance testing and general infrastructure build—are assumed complete prior to the start of this plan.

## Timeline and Milestones

To provide structure, the cutover is divided into three phases.  Dates are illustrative and can be adjusted to fit your project calendar.

### Phase 1: Pre‑Cutover Preparation (T‑4 weeks → T‑1 day)

### Phase 3: Post‑Cutover Stabilization (T+1 day → T+4 weeks)

| Timing               | Activity                                                                                 | Owner               | Notes                                                                           |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                | Responsibilities                                                                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Manager** | Coordinates the overall cutover, manages timeline, communications and escalation paths    |
| **Solution Architect** | Validates readiness, oversees technical execution, ensures adherence to design patterns   |
| **DevOps Lead**     | Prepares infrastructure, runs deployment and migration scripts, troubleshoots issues       |
| **QA Lead**         | Ensures acceptance criteria are met and tests post‑deployment functionality               |
| **Operations/Support** | Performs day‑of switch actions, monitors system health and resolves operational alerts  |
| **Business Owner**  | Authorizes change freeze, approves go/no‑go decisions and confirms success criteria       |
| **Stakeholders & End Users** | Provide feedback, receive communications and participate in validation            |

## Communication Plan

Clear communication is essential during cutover.  The project manager is responsible for coordinating updates.  A dedicated chat channel (e.g., Teams/Slack) will be created for real‑time coordination on Day 0.  Prior to cutover, weekly status emails will be sent.  During the cutover window, hourly updates will be provided.  A bridge call will be initiated if critical issues occur.  Contact details for all owners and escalation paths should be documented in the project tracker.

## Go/No‑Go Criteria

Go/no‑go decisions are made by the business owner based on the following criteria:

1. Successful completion of all pre‑cutover readiness checkpoints.
2. Migration scripts run without errors and data validation passes.
3. Smoke tests on TALON production environment complete with no critical defects.
4. All critical monitoring and alerting is active.
5. Stakeholders confirm availability to support the cutover window.

If any of these criteria are not met, the project manager will recommend delaying the cutover.

## Rollback Strategy

A rollback plan is essential to minimize downtime if the cutover fails.  The rollback triggers include severe functional failures, unacceptable performance degradation, or critical data corruption.  The rollback plan consists of:

1. **Decision point** – if key smoke tests or validations fail during cutover, the solution architect and business owner decide to roll back.  Rollback must occur before the legacy system is decommissioned.
2. **Revert traffic** – switch DNS/load balancer entries back to the legacy system and disable TALON job triggers.
3. **Restore data** – reimport backup taken at T‑2 weeks into the legacy environment.  Verify restoration using checksum and sample validation.
4. **Communicate** – promptly notify stakeholders of the rollback decision and expected downtime.
5. **Root‑cause analysis** – capture logs and metrics from the failed cutover to prevent recurrence before attempting another cutover.

Rollback scripts should be tested in a staging environment during the rehearsal to ensure they work as expected.  The legacy system should be retained in a quiescent state until post‑cutover stability is confirmed.

## Risk and Mitigation

| Risk                                | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                               |
|-------------------------------------|-----------:|-------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data migration scripts fail         | Medium     | High   | Conduct rehearsal; maintain backup and validated rollback procedure       |
| Extended downtime during cutover    | Low        | High   | Perform cutover outside peak hours; ensure resource availability          |
| Configuration drift between envs    | Medium     | Medium | Use IaC for all environments; run config drift detection before cutover   |
| Communication breakdown             | Low        | High   | Define clear communication channels and escalation tree                    |
| Unexpected performance issues       | Medium     | Medium | Implement comprehensive monitoring; establish thresholds and alerts        |
| Key personnel unavailable           | Low        | High   | Identify alternates; maintain contact information and coverage schedule    |

## Success Criteria

The cutover is deemed successful when:

- All critical TALON services (perception, infrastructure planning, policy evaluation) operate in production with no severity 1 defects.
- Latency and throughput metrics meet or exceed those established during user‑acceptance testing.
- No data loss or corruption is detected; post‑cutover audits confirm data integrity.
- Stakeholders sign off that business processes are functioning correctly on TALON.
- The legacy system is decommissioned or isolated without reactivation during the agreed retention period.

## Change Control and Documentation

Every change to this plan must be version‑controlled.  Updates require approval from the project manager and solution architect.  Lessons learned during the cutover should be incorporated into future versions.  At the conclusion of the cutover, a final report summarizing execution timings, deviations and recommendations should be produced.
