## Purpose

This document defines how observability will be implemented and measured for the TALON platform.  
It establishes key service‑level indicators (SLIs), service‑level objectives (SLOs), and high‑level dashboard requirements to ensure the platform meets performance and reliability expectations. The plan also outlines how metrics, logs and traces should be collected, stored and visualised to support troubleshooting and continuous improvement.

## Service‑Level Indicators (SLIs)

An SLI is a quantitative measure that indicates how well a service performs from the user’s perspective. For TALON we group SLIs into three categories:

1. **Performance metrics** – measures of how quickly the system responds.
2. **Reliability metrics** – measures of system availability and correctness.
3. **Quality metrics** – measures of prediction confidence and policy compliance.

### Perception Flow SLIs

- **Latency (p50/p95)** – time from job submission to inference response.  
  Measured in milliseconds; tracked as p50 (median) and p95 values.
- **Throughput** – number of jobs processed per minute.  
  Useful for capacity planning and detecting bottlenecks.
- **Success rate** – ratio of jobs that return a pass or review response versus total jobs.  
  Errors include timeouts, model errors, or infrastructure failures.
- **Prediction confidence** – average confidence score returned by the model.  
  Low confidence values may indicate model drift or poor input quality.

### Infra Flow SLIs

- **Plan time (p50/p95)** – time to generate a Terraform plan.  
  Long plan generation times may indicate heavy modules or external dependencies.
- **Approval lead time** – time from plan generation to approval decision.  
  Delays here can highlight process bottlenecks or unclear ownership.
- **Policy violation rate** – percentage of plans that fail policy checks.  
  A high rate indicates poor input or misaligned standards.
- **Apply success rate** – proportion of approved plans that apply successfully.  
  Failures can indicate configuration issues or drift.

### Platform‑wide SLIs

- **Availability** – percentage of time TALON APIs are reachable and respond within an acceptable time window.  
  Calculated as uptime divided by total time, excluding planned maintenance.
- **Error rate** – proportion of API calls returning non‑2xx responses.  
  Broken down by endpoint (perception vs infra).

## Service‑Level Objectives (SLOs)

An SLO is a target value or range of values for an SLI. SLOs provide clear goals for reliability and performance that engineering teams and stakeholders agree to uphold. When an SLO is missed, it draws attention to underlying issues and triggers investigation.

### Perception SLOs

- **Latency** –  p50 < 0.5 seconds, p95 < 2 seconds.  
  Ensures most jobs complete quickly, and outliers remain under a hard limit.
- **Success rate** – 99.5% of jobs complete without error.  
  Allows for occasional transient failures while maintaining high reliability.
- **Confidence threshold** – 95% of predictions return a confidence ≥ 0.9.  
  Flags possible model drift or poor input conditions if the threshold is not met.

### Infra SLOs

- **Plan time** – p95 < 30 seconds for generating plans in the designated environment.  
  Encourages efficient modules and minimal external dependencies.
- **Approval time** – 90% of plans receive an approval or feedback within two business days.  
  Promotes timely change reviews and reduces deployment lag.
- **Policy violation rate** – less than 10% of plans fail initial policy checks.  
  Indicates good alignment with guardrails and quality of change requests.
- **Apply success** – 99% of approved plans apply without requiring manual intervention.

### SLO Guidance

SLOs should be:

- **Attainable** – based on historical data and current capacity.  
- **Repeatable** – stable across releases and load patterns.  
- **Measurable** – derived from automated metrics.  
- **Understandable** – easily interpreted by stakeholders.  
- **Meaningful** – aligned with user expectations and business value.  
- **Controllable** – influenced by the engineering team’s actions.  
- **Affordable** – balanced against resource and cost constraints.  

An error budget accompanies each SLO. For example, with a success‑rate SLO of 99.5%, the error budget allows 0.5% of jobs to fail without breaching the objective. Budget consumption should be reviewed regularly; depletion triggers a focus on reliability over new feature development.

## Observability Architecture

### Instrumentation

TALON components must be instrumented for metrics, logs and traces:

- **Metrics** – Expose application metrics via standard endpoints (e.g., Prometheus format). Include counters, gauges, histograms for SLIs.  
- **Logs** – Use structured, machine‑readable logging. Include unique identifiers (job ID, request ID) to correlate across services. Avoid sensitive data; mask or hash PII.  
- **Traces** – Adopt distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) for end‑to‑end visibility. Each request should carry a trace context; spans must include start time, end time and metadata such as job type and result.

### Metrics Pipeline

1. **Collection** – Agents scrape metrics from service endpoints at regular intervals.  
2. **Aggregation** – Metrics are aggregated and retained in a time‑series database.  
3. **Visualization** – Dashboards present trends, SLO compliance and error budget consumption.  
4. **Alerting** – Alerts fire when SLO thresholds are breached or when error budgets are being consumed too quickly. Use multiple severity levels (warning vs critical) and rate limits to avoid alert fatigue.

### Dashboards

Provide separate but consistent dashboards for the perception and infra flows:

#### Perception Dashboard

- **Latency charts** – p50 and p95 latencies over time.  
- **Throughput** – jobs processed per minute/hour.  
- **Success vs error** – stacked bar showing successful jobs vs failures.  
- **Confidence distribution** – histogram of prediction confidences.  
- **Error budget consumption** – gauge visualising remaining error budget for the current period.

#### Infra Dashboard

- **Plan time** – distribution of plan generation times.  
- **Approval status** – number of plans pending approval, approved, or rejected.  
- **Policy violations** – count and types of violations detected.  
- **Apply success** – success/failure ratio of applies.  
- **Change velocity** – number of change requests per week.

#### Platform Health Dashboard

- **Availability & error rate** – high‑level view of API uptime and error counts.  
- **System resources** – CPU, memory and disk utilisation of key services.  
- **Queue depth** – number of jobs waiting in the processing queue.  
- **Alert overview** – list of active alerts and their status.

Dashboards should support drill‑down into individual traces or logs for troubleshooting. Use templating and grouping to compare environments (e.g., staging vs production).

## Alerting & Incident Response

### Alert Policies

Alerts should be defined for:

- Breaching SLO thresholds (e.g., p95 latency exceeds limit for 5 minutes).  
- Rapid error budget depletion.  
- Increase in error rate or policy violation rate beyond normal variance.  
- Infrastructure resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, queue length).  

Each alert must specify severity, notification channel (email, chat, pager), and on‑call rotation. Use escalation policies to ensure unresolved alerts are addressed promptly.

### Incident Workflow

1. **Detection** – Alert triggers; incident is recorded.  
2. **Triage** – On‑call examines dashboards, logs and traces to identify root cause.  
3. **Mitigation** – Take immediate steps (e.g., rollback, scale up, adjust configuration) to restore service levels.  
4. **Resolution** – Confirm SLOs are back within thresholds.  
5. **Post‑mortem** – Conduct a blameless review. Document timeline, contributing factors, lessons learned and improvement actions.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Consistent naming** – Use a naming scheme for metrics (e.g., `talon_perception_latency_ms`, `talon_infra_plan_duration_ms`) that reflects component, flow and unit.  
- **Tagging/labels** – Include labels for environment, version, job type, and region to support filtering.  
- **Data retention** – Retain raw metrics for 30 days, aggregated metrics for 90 days, and summarised trend data for one year or as required by business.  
- **Secure storage** – Protect metrics and logs with appropriate access controls and encryption at rest.  
- **Testing** – Validate instrumentation with unit and integration tests; ensure metrics increment correctly and labels propagate.  
- **Automation** – Provision monitoring infrastructure with infrastructure‑as‑code; use continuous delivery to roll out dashboards and alert policies.

## Continuous Improvement

Observability is not a one‑off effort. It requires ongoing refinement:

- Periodically review SLIs and SLOs to ensure they reflect current user expectations and system capabilities.  
- Track error budgets; if budgets are regularly exhausted, allocate time to reliability work.  
- Update dashboards and alerts based on incident reviews.  
- Share observability metrics and insights with stakeholders to drive data‑driven decisions.  
- Evaluate new tooling (e.g., telemetry libraries, anomaly detection) and update the observability stack as needed.
