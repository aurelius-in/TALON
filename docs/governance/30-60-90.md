---

This 30/60/90 day plan describes a phased approach to delivering TALON for Blue Eagle Robotics.  Each phase has clear objectives, activities, owners and deliverables.  The goal is to move from proof of concept to a hardened platform and then to a production pilot, demonstrating value at each milestone.

## Phase 1 (0–30 Days) — Prove

**Objectives:**

- Stand up a minimum viable version of TALON that exercises both perception and infrastructure workflows end‑to‑end.  
- Validate core functionality against acceptance criteria for accuracy, latency and policy enforcement.  
- Capture initial feedback and identify technical risks early.

**Key Activities:**

- **Environment setup:**
  - Provision a sandbox environment with the control plane, GPU‑enabled cluster and object storage.  
  - Install required tooling (Terraform, FastAPI, OPA, container runtime) and establish Git repository structure.
- **Baseline architecture & documentation:**
  - Produce a high‑level design (HLD) and a low‑level design (LLD) for the pilot, including data flows, API definitions and security measures.  
  - Review with stakeholders and refine.
- **Proof‑of‑concept implementation:**
  - Implement a simple AI perception pipeline with PTZ camera simulation, queue, inference service and result logging.  
  - Implement an infrastructure plan/approve/apply workflow with at least one Terraform module and a policy check.  
  - Generate sample provenance records for both flows.
- **Initial policies & thresholds:**
  - Define baseline policy thresholds for confidence and latency in perception.  
  - Author a basic OPA policy (e.g. naming conventions) for infrastructure changes.  
  - Integrate policy evaluation into both flows.
- **Smoke tests and validation:**
  - Execute perception and infrastructure jobs via API; measure latency and verify outputs.  
  - Log and document results.  
  - Identify initial gaps and create tickets for remediation.

**Deliverables:**

- Sandbox environment configured with working TALON control plane.  
- Minimal working pipeline for perception and provisioning.  
- HLD/LLD documentation.  
- Draft policies and thresholds.  
- Initial runbooks (deploy, triage, rollback).  
- Report summarising POC results and recommendations for Phase 2.

## Phase 2 (31–60 Days) — Harden

**Objectives:**

- Strengthen the platform for reliability, security and maintainability.  
- Increase automation and test coverage.  
- Prepare the system for real‑world deployment by integrating observability and governance.

**Key Activities:**

- **Expand functionality:**
  - Enhance the perception pipeline with production‑grade models and real camera inputs.  
  - Add additional Terraform modules to cover networking, identity and monitoring resources.  
  - Implement multi‑agent orchestration (planner, vision, infra, policy, provenance, operator).
- **CI/CD & image signing:**
  - Implement a build pipeline that compiles code, runs unit tests and static analysis, signs container images and attaches SBOMs.  
  - Introduce plan→policy→approval→apply stages with manual approval gates.  
  - Enforce signed images and provenance storage.
- **Security hardening:**
  - Apply least privilege roles, network segmentation and encrypted storage.  
  - Integrate multi‑factor authentication and keyless signing.  
  - Expand OPA policy packs with cost controls, tag enforcement, and resource whitelisting.
- **Observability & SLOs:**
  - Define service‑level indicators (SLIs) and objectives (SLOs) for latency, accuracy, availability and plan success.  
  - Develop dashboards to visualise KPIs such as throughput, error rates, resource utilisation and cost.  
  - Configure alerting based on SLO thresholds and establish escalation procedures.
- **Testing & quality:**
  - Create unit, integration and end‑to‑end tests covering perception and provisioning flows.  
  - Run performance tests to validate scalability and capacity.  
  - Conduct security assessments (threat modelling, vulnerability scanning).
- **Documentation & training:**
  - Update runbooks and design documents with details from hardened implementation.  
  - Provide knowledge‑transfer sessions to operations and development teams.  
  - Prepare a cutover plan for the pilot deployment.

**Deliverables:**

- Hardened TALON control plane with robust pipelines and policies.  
- CI/CD pipeline with image signing and SBOM attestation.  
- Comprehensive OPA policy pack.  
- Observability dashboards and configured alerts.  
- Updated documentation and training materials.  
- Cutover plan and risk register for Phase 3.

## Phase 3 (61–90 Days) — Pilot

**Objectives:**

- Deploy TALON to a production pilot (e.g. one manufacturing line or a designated environment).  
- Validate performance and reliability under real workloads.  
- Demonstrate business value and prepare for broader rollout.

**Key Activities:**

- **Pilot deployment:**
  - Execute the cutover plan, migrating from the sandbox to the pilot environment.  
  - Sync configuration and deploy signed containers via GitOps with approved manifests.  
  - Onboard pilot users and set up necessary connectivity (VPNs, firewalls, identity federation).
- **Monitoring & tuning:**
  - Monitor SLIs (latency, accuracy, throughput) against SLOs.  
  - Collect user feedback on system usability and performance.  
  - Investigate and remediate incidents; adjust policies and thresholds based on real data.
- **Operational validation:**
  - Test rollback procedures and disaster recovery capabilities.  
  - Validate runbooks with the operations team and refine as needed.  
  - Measure MTTR and other support KPIs during pilot.
- **Post‑pilot evaluation:**
  - Conduct a formal review with stakeholders to assess outcomes and ROI.  
  - Capture lessons learned and incorporate them into final design.  
  - Develop a roadmap for scaling to additional lines or environments.

**Deliverables:**

- Pilot environment fully operational with TALON delivering production gauge readings and infrastructure automation.  
- Post‑pilot report with measured metrics, user feedback and recommendations.  
- Updated documentation and refined runbooks.  
- Go‑forward plan for scaling TALON across the organisation.

## Roles and responsibilities

- **Solution Architect (RAIN)** — Leads design, coordinates all technical workstreams, and ensures alignment with SLOs and business goals.  
- **Engineering team (RAIN)** — Implements pipelines, modules, policies and tests; builds dashboards and CI/CD automation.  
- **Operations team (BER)** — Provides infrastructure access, participates in runbook validation, monitors systems and responds to alerts.  
- **Security & compliance (BER/RAIN)** — Reviews policies, approves artefacts, conducts security assessments and ensures regulatory adherence.  
- **Stakeholders/Product owners (BER)** — Provide requirements, prioritise features and participate in acceptance reviews.

## Success criteria

The project will be considered a success when the following conditions are met:

- End‑to‑end perception and provisioning flows operate reliably and meet defined SLOs.  
- Policies and guardrails prevent unsafe changes and enforce compliance without causing undue friction.  
- Metrics show sustained accuracy and latency within targets under pilot conditions.  
- Dashboards and alerts provide actionable insights, and runbooks are followed successfully by the operations team.  
- The pilot deployment demonstrates clear business value and a viable path to full roll‑out.
