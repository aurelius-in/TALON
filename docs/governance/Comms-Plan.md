## Overview

A clear communication plan keeps the TALON project on track, ensures alignment across cross‑functional teams and promotes timely decision‑making.  This document describes the cadence, purpose and participants for recurring meetings and outlines the tools used to share information.

## Daily Stand‑up

- **Frequency:** Every working day at the same time and location (typically 15 minutes).  
- **Participants:** Core delivery team – solution architect, developers, DevOps engineer, QA, and product owner.  
- **Purpose:** Share progress since the last stand‑up, declare intentions for the current day and surface any impediments requiring assistance.  Stand‑ups are for team members to sync with each other, not to provide a status report to management.  Keeping the meeting timeboxed encourages conciseness and helps identify issues early.  
- **Agenda:** Each participant answers three questions:
  1. What did I work on yesterday?  
  2. What will I work on today?  
  3. What impediments or risks do I see?
- **Outputs:** Action items captured for follow‑up conversations; blockers escalated to the solution architect or product owner outside the meeting.

## Architecture Review Board (ARB)

- **Frequency:** Scheduled at least once per month, with additional sessions as needed for major proposals or design changes.  
- **Participants:** Solution architect (chair), senior engineers, security lead, product owner, and representatives from the client’s technical teams.  
- **Purpose:** Provide governance and technical oversight of the TALON architecture.  The ARB reviews new designs, evaluates proposed changes, ensures alignment with enterprise standards and strategic objectives, and resolves architectural disputes.  
- **Agenda:**
  1. Review open architectural decisions and status of action items.  
  2. Present new proposals or design changes for discussion and approval.  
  3. Assess compliance with policies and standards (security, scalability, maintainability).  
  4. Document decisions, rationale and follow‑up actions.  
- **Outputs:** Approved architecture decisions, recorded in the decision log; recommendations or required modifications; updated technical roadmap.

## Steering Committee

- **Frequency:** Monthly or at major milestones.  
- **Participants:** Project sponsor from BER, executive sponsor from RAIN, solution architect, product owner, and key stakeholders from both organizations (e.g., finance, operations).  
- **Purpose:** Provide high‑level guidance, align the project with business goals and manage risks.  The steering committee reviews progress, budget, scope, quality and schedule.  It resolves escalated issues and approves changes that impact project objectives.  
- **Agenda:**
  1. Progress update and key metrics (budget, schedule, risks).  
  2. Review of deliverables, milestones and upcoming activities.  
  3. Discussion of strategic decisions and change requests requiring executive approval.  
  4. Confirmation of resources and next steps.  
- **Outputs:** Steering committee minutes, decisions on scope/schedule/budget, risk mitigation actions.

## Change Advisory Board (CAB)

- **Frequency:** Weekly or more frequently when there is a high volume of changes; emergency CAB sessions convened for urgent changes.  
- **Participants:** Change manager (facilitator), solution architect, DevOps engineer, product owner, operations representative, security lead and other subject‑matter experts as needed.  
- **Purpose:** Review, prioritise and approve planned changes to the environment.  The CAB ensures that each change has a clear business justification, has been tested appropriately and meets risk and compliance requirements.  
- **Agenda:**
  1. Review the change calendar and upcoming changes.  
  2. Assess change requests, including business impact, risk assessment, test results and back‑out plan.  
  3. Approve, reject or defer changes.  
  4. Review outcomes of recently implemented changes and discuss lessons learned.  
- **Outputs:** Authorised change schedule; documented decisions and rationales; updates to change management records; improved change process based on feedback.

## Additional Cadence Meetings

- **Sprint Planning & Retrospectives:** If the team is using an agile development approach, hold sprint planning sessions at the beginning of each sprint (typically every 2 weeks) to prioritise work and commit to user stories.  Retrospectives occur at the end of each sprint to reflect on what went well and identify improvements.
- **Backlog Refinement:** Weekly or bi‑weekly meetings where the product owner and delivery team clarify requirements, refine user stories and estimate effort for upcoming work.  
- **Technical Huddles:** Ad hoc or scheduled sessions to deep‑dive on technical challenges, pair programming, design spikes or code reviews.  Participants vary based on topic.

## Communication Tools

- **Messaging & Collaboration:** Microsoft Teams (instant messaging, channels), Slack (if available).  These tools support asynchronous communication, quick questions and announcements.  
- **Videoconferencing:** Cisco Webex or Microsoft Teams for stand‑ups, ARB, steering and CAB meetings.  Ensure meetings are recorded and transcripts archived for reference.  
- **Issue Tracking:** Jira (for backlog items, tasks and change requests).  Links to Jira tickets should be included in meeting agendas and follow‑up notes.  
- **Documentation:** Confluence or SharePoint to store meeting minutes, decision logs, design documentation, runbooks and policies.  
- **Dashboards:** Grafana, Power BI or similar for real‑time visibility into KPIs, SLOs and system health.  Meeting agendas should reference relevant dashboard links to inform discussions.

## Best Practices

- **Standardise agendas:** Use a consistent format for each meeting type to ensure nothing is overlooked and participants know what to expect.  Circulate the agenda in advance.  
- **Timebox discussions:** Keep meetings within the allotted timeframe.  Stand‑ups should not exceed 15 minutes; ARB and CAB meetings should focus on decision‑making rather than updates.  Longer discussions can be scheduled separately.  
- **Document decisions and actions:** Assign a note‑taker for each meeting to capture key points, decisions and action items.  Share minutes promptly and track action item completion.  
- **Encourage inclusive participation:** Make sure all voices are heard, especially during design and change reviews.  Rotate facilitators when possible.  
- **Review and adjust cadence:** Periodically evaluate whether the meeting cadence and format remain effective.  Adjust frequency or participants based on project phase, workload and feedback.
