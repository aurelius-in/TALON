## Purpose

This document defines how data generated and consumed by the TALON platform should be classified and handled throughout its lifecycle.  A clear classification scheme enables appropriate security controls, retention policies, and access restrictions.  These guidelines apply to all personnel who create, process or store data for Blue Eagle Robotics and Reliable AI Network.

## Classification levels

The TALON data classification scheme uses four levels of sensitivity.  Each level determines the handling requirements for access, storage, transmission, retention and disposal.

| Level | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Public** | Information intended for open sharing with no risk if disclosed. | Marketing materials, published whitepapers, release notes, anonymized benchmark results. |
| **Internal** | Non‑public information used within BER and RAIN.  Disclosure would cause minimal harm. | Internal process documentation, system architecture overviews, deployment runbooks, aggregated performance metrics without sensitive details. |
| **Confidential** | Sensitive data whose unauthorized disclosure could harm the organization or its customers. | Proprietary algorithms, model weights, infrastructure configuration files, logs containing IP addresses, device serial numbers, or per‑customer usage statistics. |
| **Restricted** | Highly sensitive data that could cause significant harm if compromised.  This includes personal data protected by law or contract. | Authentication credentials, encryption keys, financial account numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), payment card data, trade secrets. |

## Handling guidelines

### Access controls

- **Need‑to‑know:** Access to data must be granted based on job responsibilities.  Only individuals who require information to perform their duties should have access.  
- **Role‑based access control (RBAC):** Assign roles for different user categories (e.g., developer, operator, administrator, auditor) and map classification levels to allowed actions.  
- **Authentication & authorization:** Use strong authentication mechanisms and multi‑factor authentication for Restricted data.  Review permissions periodically and revoke unused access.

### Storage and transmission

- **Encryption:** Encrypt Confidential and Restricted data at rest and in transit using approved cryptographic standards.  Key management practices must prevent unauthorized access to encryption keys.
- **Approved repositories:** Store data only in approved systems.  Public and Internal data may reside in shared platforms (e.g., version control, wiki) with access controls.  Confidential and Restricted data must be stored in secure systems with auditing and logging.
- **Segmentation:** Isolate environments (development, staging, production) and restrict data replication between them.  Confidential and Restricted data should never be copied to lower environments without explicit authorization and masking.

### Retention and disposal

- **Retention period:** Define retention periods based on business needs, regulatory requirements and classification.  As a general guideline:
  - Public and Internal data should be retained as long as it remains relevant and accurate.
  - Confidential data (e.g., logs, configuration versions) should be retained only for the minimum period required for troubleshooting, audit or compliance (typically 90 days to one year).  After expiry, securely archive or delete it.
  - Restricted data should be retained for the shortest time necessary to fulfil its purpose and then securely destroyed.  Do not store personal data indefinitely.
- **Secure disposal:** Use secure deletion or media sanitization methods to ensure data cannot be reconstructed.  Document disposal activities.

### Transmission rules

- **Secure channels:** Use TLS/SSL for all network transmissions of Internal, Confidential and Restricted data.  Avoid sending Restricted data over unencrypted channels (e.g., email) unless it is encrypted separately.  
- **Data minimization:** Share only the minimum necessary fields.  Strip or hash identifiers and sensitive values before transmitting data to third parties or logging systems.

## PII avoidance and protection

Personally identifiable information (PII) is considered Restricted.  To minimize risk:

- **Minimize collection:** Collect PII only when strictly required for business or regulatory purposes.  When possible, use anonymized or aggregated data instead of raw identifiers.
- **Masking and hashing:** When logging or storing PII (e.g., user IDs, IP addresses), mask or hash values so that direct identification is not possible.  Avoid including PII in URL parameters or logs.
- **Consent and legal compliance:** Ensure data collection and handling comply with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA).  Obtain consent where required and respect data subject rights such as the right to deletion.  
- **De‑identification:** Use pseudonymization techniques (tokenization, hashing, or scrambling) when the original identity is not necessary for processing.  
- **Monitoring & alerts:** Implement monitoring to detect and prevent PII exposure in logs or data stores.  Investigate and remediate incidents promptly.

## Logging guidelines

Logging is essential for troubleshooting and security, but logs must not leak sensitive information.  Follow these practices:

- **Exclude sensitive data:** Do not log application source code, session identifiers, access tokens, passwords, encryption keys, bank account numbers, or any PII unless legally required.  Mask or redact any sensitive data that must be logged for correlation purposes.  
- **Classification flags:** Tag each log entry with a classification label to reflect the sensitivity of the data it contains.  
- **Centralized logging:** Collect logs in a central, secure repository with access controls.  Ensure log integrity and protect logs from tampering.  
- **Retention:** Retain logs containing Confidential data for a defined period (e.g., 90 days).  After that, archive or delete them securely.  For Restricted data, apply stricter retention and disposal rules.

## Roles and responsibilities

- **Data owners:** Business or technical leaders accountable for defining classification and retention for data sets under their control.  
- **Data custodians:** IT and DevOps personnel responsible for implementing technical controls (access, encryption, logging) and enforcing policies.  
- **Data users:** All personnel who access or process data; must understand and adhere to classification and handling requirements.  
- **Security team:** Develops and maintains policies, provides training and performs audits to verify compliance.  

## Implementation and training

- **Labeling:** Apply classification labels to documents, repositories and structured data.  Use metadata tags in code repositories, databases and object storage buckets.  
- **Automation:** Leverage automated scanning tools to discover and classify data across environments.  Employ data loss prevention (DLP) solutions to prevent unauthorized transmission.  
- **Training:** Provide periodic training to all employees on data classification levels, handling procedures and privacy obligations.  Use real‑world examples to illustrate consequences of mishandling.  
- **Policy review:** Review classification and handling policies at least annually or when business processes or regulations change.  Update procedures and systems accordingly.
