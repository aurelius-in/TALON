# Disaster Recovery Plan

**Customer/Vendor:** Blue Eagle Robotics (BER) / Reliable AI Network (RAIN)  
**Product:** TALON — Tactical Agentic Layer for Orchestrated eNvironments  
**Version/Date:** v0.1 • 2025-09-05

---

## 1) Purpose
Define how TALON is protected against disruptive events and how it is recovered within agreed Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO). This plan is actionable, testable, and versioned alongside the platform.

## 2) Scope
Covers control‑plane, workers, policy engine, CI/CD and GitOps repos, artifact registry, signing services, object storage, and database(s) used by TALON for a single primary site with optional warm standby at a secondary site.

## 3) Objectives
- Meet or beat RTO/RPO targets for each critical service.  
- Provide clear runbooks for failover, failback, and partial restores.  
- Exercise the plan on a recurring cadence and capture improvements.

## 4) Definitions
- **RTO**: Maximum allowed downtime to restore service.  
- **RPO**: Maximum allowed data loss measured as time since last good restore point.  
- **MAO**: Maximum allowable outage for the business process.  
- **DR mode**: Operation at reduced capacity or with temporary limitations during recovery.

## 5) Critical Services & Targets
| Service | Description | RTO | RPO | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TALON API | Control‑plane API & queue access | 2 h | 15 min | Minimal readiness UI acceptable in DR |
| Policy Engine | OPA policy evaluation | 2 h | 15 min | Must load signed policy bundle |
| Perception Workers | Inference workers | 4 h | 30 min | Reduced concurrency allowed |
| Infra Runner | Plan/Apply automation | 8 h | 60 min | Suspend applies during disaster |
| Artifact Registry | Container images, attestations | 4 h | 0 min | Images are immutable by digest |
| Signing Service | Keys, cosign materials | 4 h | 0 min | Keys escrowed, HSM preferred |
| Object Storage | Evidence, frames, reports | 8 h | 30 min | Tiered retention |
| Observability | Logs/metrics/traces | 8 h | 60 min | DR can run with partial history |
| Git Repos | GitOps + app repos | 2 h | 0–15 min | Mirror + protected backups |

> Replace targets with contract values as needed.

## 6) Assumptions
- Primary site has redundant power/network. Secondary site has sufficient capacity to operate at 60–80% of peak for 72 hours.  
- All images and plans are signed; verification is enforced during DR.  
- All backups are encrypted at rest and in transit.

## 7) Backup & Replication
**Repositories**:  
- Git (config/policy/manifests): hourly incremental; daily full; 30‑day retention; off‑site mirror.  
- Registry: no backup needed for images (immutable); backup registry metadata and signatures hourly.  
- Object storage: daily snapshot; 30‑day standard, 90‑day archive.  
- Databases: WAL streaming to standby; hourly snapshot; 7‑day PITR window.  
- Observability: daily export of dashboards; metrics TSDB snapshot daily; logs shipped to off‑site bucket.

**Key Material**:  
- Signing keys in HSM/KMS with dual‑control escrow.  
- Rotation schedule documented; recover from escrow only with two‑person approval.

## 8) DR Scenarios & Playbooks
### A) Loss of Control‑Plane Cluster
**Symptoms**: API unreachable; health checks failing.  
**Action**:  
1. Declare incident (Severity 1).  
2. Bootstrap DR cluster using GitOps bootstrap bundle (latest signed release).  
3. Restore secrets from KMS; load policy bundle; validate signature.  
4. Point DNS or VIP to DR API; run smoke tests (auth, queue, policy).  
5. Announce DR mode; enable reduced concurrency if needed.

### B) Registry or Signing Service Failure
**Symptoms**: Verify step fails; image pulls fail.  
**Action**:  
1. Switch image pulls to mirror registry; import recent signatures.  
2. If signing unavailable, freeze new deploys; operate with cached images.  
3. Restore signing infra in DR; validate key integrity with out‑of‑band checks.

### C) Object Storage/Data Corruption
**Symptoms**: Missing evidence or errors on reads.  
**Action**:  
1. Freeze writes; snapshot current state.  
2. Restore bucket to last good snapshot within RPO; re‑run affected jobs if needed.  
3. Resume writes; verify with sample reads and checksum audit.

### D) Site‑Wide Outage
**Symptoms**: Complete site loss.  
**Action**:  
1. Activate secondary site; scale to predefined DR capacity.  
2. Promote database standby; confirm replication status.  
3. Pull last signed Git tag of env manifests; reconcile.  
4. Update external DNS; validate client access; run end‑to‑end smoke.  
5. Communicate DR mode restrictions and expected timelines.

### E) Security Event (Supply‑Chain)
**Symptoms**: Signature mismatch; tampered artifacts.  
**Action**:  
1. Quarantine affected digests; block admission by policy.  
2. Rebuild from last known‑good commit; re‑sign with emergency keys if needed.  
3. Audit transparency log and compare SBOMs; restore trust store if altered.

## 9) Failover & Failback
- **Failover**: Prefer push‑button GitOps bootstrap with a pre‑built DR release bundle. DNS cutover via low TTL records or traffic manager.  
- **Failback**: Once primary is healthy, reconcile from DR back to primary, re‑enable replication, and drain traffic over a maintenance window. Validate parity before decommissioning DR mode.

## 10) DR Runbooks (Command‑Level Examples)
**Bootstrap DR control‑plane**  
```bash
# Fetch signed bundle and verify
cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub --signature talon-dr.signed talon-dr.tar.gz
tar xzf talon-dr.tar.gz
kubectl apply -k bootstrap/

# Point GitOps at env manifests
argocd app create talon --repo https://git.example/ops.git --path envs/prod --dest-server https://k8s-dr:6443
argocd app sync talon
```

**Promote DB standby**  
```bash
# Example for Postgres with repmgr
repmgr standby promote
repmgr cluster show
```

**DNS cutover**  
```bash
# Example (placeholder): set low TTL and switch record
cli-dns set --zone ber.example --record api.talon --ip 203.0.113.42 --ttl 60
```

## 11) Monitoring During DR
- Extra panels: replication lag, object‑restore progress, GitOps sync status, admission denials.  
- Page on: RTO breach forecast, replication stalled, unsigned image admission attempts, policy deny spikes.

## 12) Testing & Exercises
- **Tabletop** (monthly): 60‑minute scenario walk‑through with decisions captured.  
- **Technical** (quarterly): partial restore (e.g., object bucket, Git mirror).  
- **Full DR** (annually): secondary site activation with DNS cutover and controlled client traffic.  
- Capture RTO/RPO achieved, gaps, and specific corrective actions. Track action closure.

## 13) Roles & Responsibilities
- **Incident Commander** (PM/SA): owns DR activation, comms, and cutover approval.  
- **Platform/SRE**: bootstrap clusters, GitOps, registry/signing, DNS.  
- **Security**: key escrow, policy integrity, forensics on supply‑chain events.  
- **Application/ML**: validate perception pipelines and rebuild model caches.  
- **Stakeholders**: approve DR mode; accept recovery and failback windows.

## 14) Communications
- Initial alert to stakeholders within 15 minutes of DR activation.  
- Status cadence: every 30–60 minutes until service stable; then hourly.  
- One page that lists current mode, known limitations, and next checkpoint.  
- Post‑incident report within 5 business days.

## 15) Readiness Checklist
- [ ] DR bundle produced for each release; signed and stored off‑site.  
- [ ] Git mirrors healthy; last sync < 15 minutes.  
- [ ] Key escrow validated in last quarter.  
- [ ] Secondary site capacity test in last 90 days.  
- [ ] Runbooks reviewed and command examples updated.  
- [ ] Contact roster verified this month.

## 16) Change Control
All changes to RTO/RPO, DR targets, or runbooks are proposed via PR and reviewed by the Solution Architect and BER Engineering Director. A change may require a DR test if it affects recovery behavior.
