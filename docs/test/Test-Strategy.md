# Test Strategy

**Customer/Vendor:** Blue Eagle Robotics (BER) / Reliable AI Network (RAIN)  
**Product:** TALON — Tactical Agentic Layer for Orchestrated eNvironments  
**Version/Date:** v0.1 • 2025-09-05  

---

## 1) Purpose
Define a pragmatic, automation‑first approach to validate TALON’s correctness, performance, reliability, and safety across all environments. This strategy aligns testing with risks, SLIs/SLOs, and delivery cadence.

## 2) Quality Goals
- **Correctness:** APIs and jobs behave to spec with strong contracts.  
- **Reliability:** Meet SLOs; graceful degradation under load/faults.  
- **Security:** Signed artifacts; policy‑driven admission; least privilege.  
- **Observability:** Every test leaves useful traces/metrics/logs.  
- **Maintainability:** Fast feedback; stable tests; low flake rate.  

## 3) Test Levels (Automation Pyramid)
| Level | Focus | Examples | Target Ownership |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unit** | Pure logic, small scope | parsing, policy helpers | Dev |
| **Component** | Service in isolation (container) | API handlers, worker adapters | Dev |
| **Contract** | Producer/consumer API compatibility | OpenAPI, JSON schema, mock servers | Dev |
| **Integration** | Multiple services + DB/cache | API + queue + worker | Dev + SRE |
| **E2E** | User‑visible flows | submit job → result; plan → apply (gated) | QA/Dev/SRE |
| **Non‑Functional** | Perf, soak, chaos, security, accessibility | k6, chaos, vuln scan | SRE + Sec + Dev |

> Bias toward **more unit/contract** and **few stable E2E** per critical flow.

## 4) Environments
| Env | Purpose | Data | Change Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **dev** | fast feedback | synthetic | on merge to main |
| **stage** | pre‑prod, UAT, perf | masked/synthetic | change window |
| **prod** | runtime validation (safe checks) | synthetic only | CAB approvals |

## 5) Test Types & Minimum Coverage
- **Unit** (≥70% line, ≥80% critical paths): run on PR.  
- **Component**: containerized test targets with test doubles for external deps.  
- **Contract**: verify OpenAPI + JSON schemas; publish artifacts; backward‑compat checks.  
- **Integration**: docker‑compose/k8s‑kind; real queue/storage; seeded data.  
- **E2E**: smoke (per merge), regression (nightly), happy‑path + key error paths.  
- **Performance**: baseline + load + spike + soak; thresholds aligned to SLOs.  
- **Security**: SAST/secret scan on PR; image scan on build; admission denies unsigned.  
- **Resilience/Chaos**: node loss, latency injection, registry delay, policy‑deny storm.  
- **Data Quality**: schema drift, required fields, value bounds, PII checks.  
- **Accessibility** (console): lint + assistive tech basics (if UI present).

## 6) CI/CD Gates (Plan → Policy → Approval → Apply)
| Stage | Required Checks (examples) | Blocks Merge? |
|---|---|---|
| **Build** | compile, unit tests, lint, SBOM | yes |
| **Sign** | image + SBOM signatures | yes |
| **Plan (PR)** | integration tests in ephemeral env; contract tests | yes |
| **Policy** | OPA rules: security, safety, tagging | yes |
| **Approval** | code owners; change ticket link | yes |
| **Apply** | post‑deploy smoke + health; canary if configured | auto‑rollback |

## 7) Test Data Management
- Prefer **synthetic** data; avoid production PII.  
- Provide small, deterministic seed sets for fast tests; larger sets for perf/soak.  
- Version seed data with tests; label with `test_id` and scenario metadata.  
- Red‑golden datasets for perception (e.g., glare/blur/occlusion cases).

## 8) Traceability
- Map requirements → tests → dashboards using IDs in code and docs.  
- ADRs reference affected tests; CI publishes trace matrix artifacts.  
- Every run exports a machine‑readable summary (JSON) with commit SHA and build provenance.

## 9) Flake & Stability Policy
- Track pass rate per test; quarantine flaky tests with time‑boxed fix owner.  
- Fail the build if a quarantined test affects a critical path.  
- Enforce deterministic seeds, retries only where idempotent and justified.

## 10) Defect Severity & Triage
| Sev | Definition | Examples | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Critical; blocks delivery or safety | data loss, unsigned deploy admitted | hotfix & page |
| **2** | Major; function broken or SLO breach | incorrect plan/apply; pipeline halt | prioritize next sprint |
| **3** | Moderate; workaround exists | UI issue, minor latency regression | schedule |
| **4** | Low; cosmetic/tooling | typo, log noise | backlog |

## 11) Tooling (suggested)
- **Unit/Component**: pytest/Jest/JUnit; testcontainers.  
- **Contract**: Spectral/Prism, schemathesis.  
- **Integration/E2E**: Playwright or Cypress (UI), k6/Locust (API), docker‑compose/kind.  
- **Security**: Semgrep/trufflehog; image scanner; cosign verify.  
- **Resilience**: chaos tooling (e.g., kube‑native fault injection).  
- **Reporting**: Allure/HTML; artifacts stored with build.

## 12) Release Criteria (per env)
- **dev**: all PR gates pass; smoke green.  
- **stage**: regression + perf at nominal + security scans clean or exception filed.  
- **prod**: canary pass; policy gates green; error budget not burning > policy; rollback plan validated.

## 13) Performance & Reliability Hooks
- Tag test traffic; isolate from real operator data.  
- Collect p50/p90/p95/p99 latency, error rate, saturation, queue depth, policy decisions.  
- Soak detection for memory/leaks (>5% upward trend over 8h).

## 14) Change Management
- Tests versioned with code; changes via PR with reviewers.  
- Breaking API or policy changes require contract test updates + migration notes.  
- Keep a **Test Readme** per service with how to run locally and in CI.

## 15) Reporting & Reviews
- **On PR**: summary status with links to failed steps and logs.  
- **Daily**: dashboard of flake rate, mean build time, pass rate by suite.  
- **Weekly**: review top failures and action owners; compare against goals.

## 16) RACI (summary)
| Area | R | A | C | I |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unit/Component | Dev | Dev Lead | SA | SRE |
| Contract | Dev | SA | Dev Lead | QA |
| Integration | Dev | Dev Lead | SRE | SA |
| E2E | QA/SRE | SA | Dev Lead | Stakeholders |
| Perf/Chaos | SRE | SA | Dev | Sec |
| Security | Sec | SA | SRE | Dev |

## 17) Risks & Mitigations
- **Env drift** → GitOps, frequent reprovision, ephemeral test envs.  
- **Flaky tests** → determinism, timeouts, isolate external deps.  
- **Slow feedback** → parallelize, split suites, test impact analysis.  
- **Insufficient data variety** → synthetic generators, red‑golden sets.  

## 18) Roadmap (next 90 days)
- Stand up contract testing in CI; publish OpenAPI nightly.  
- Add k6 performance suite with thresholds; wire to dashboards.  
- Introduce chaos scenarios into stage.  
- Reduce flake rate < 1% and mean PR time < 15 minutes.

## 19) Glossary
- **SLO/SLI** — Service Level Objective/Indicator.  
- **Canary** — Partial rollout to detect regressions safely.  
- **Error Budget** — Allowable unreliability before releases slow.
